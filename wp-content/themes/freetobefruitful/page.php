After attending a Billy Graham crusade at Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas in the fall of 1971 as a senior in high school, he accepted and trusted Christ right out of a Billy Graham tract. &nbsp;While attending college at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas, he was actively involved with the campus ministry of the Navigators. He graduated from Sam Houston State University in with a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminology and Corrections in 1975.</p>
            <p>After working for the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office for 1Â½ years after college, he resigned and began a career in the oil and gas business as a landman working for medium sized exploration and production companies in Houston, Texas.</p>
            <p>At the age of 33 and just after having been the prodigal son for 7 years, Jack prayed for the Lord to send him a wife which the Lord did just three months later. He has now been married to his beautiful wife Debbie since 1988 and have one son, Christopher Luke.</p>
            <p>In 1993 Jack transferred to Denver where he was employed full time until he resigned to attend Rocky Mountain Bible Institute at the age 40 to pursue God's call on his life for ministry. Jack is the son of Matthew 21:28-29 who would not go and work when his father asked him to, but later changed his mind and went! He graduated from Rocky Mountain Bible Institute in 1997 with an Associates of Arts Degree in Biblical Studies.</p>
